### Instalar Jupyter Lab

Generate a Jupyter Notebook configuration file.

jupyter notebook --generate-config

The configuration file is created in /home/ubuntu/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py, which is outside the environment. As a result, the configuration applies to every Jupyter Notebook instance, no matter which environment it is in.
Open the configuration file in a text editor such as nano or vi, and add the following lines to the beginning:

c = get_config()
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 8888

Add a password to Jupyter Notebook. When prompted, enter a suitably strong password. You can run this command any time that you want to change the password.

jupyter notebook password

Install a certificate for encrypted communications over HTTPS. To install a self-signed certificate:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout jupyter-key.key -out jupyter-cert.pem

Start Jupyter Notebook.

jupyter notebook --certfile=jupyter-cert.pem --keyfile=jupyter-key.key
