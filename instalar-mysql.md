I know this an old Question but i feel this might help someone. I was recently faced with the same problem but in my case, i remember my password quite alright but it kept on giving me the same error. I tried so many solutions but still none helped then i tried this

mysql -u root -p 

after which it asks you for a pass word like this

Enter password: 

and then i typed in the password i used. That's all
